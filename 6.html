  2019.03 - 2019.04 <strong>Objet</strong> for academic project. One of the freshman studio activities was to analysis human proportion factors and make objet using the analysed elements.
  <p>I analysed one of the gymnastics movement and made diagram focused on major joints such as knees and pelvis. The result of that was shown through fan shapes and triangles.</p>
  <p>Afterwards, I made the objet using those figures. The pelvis was taken as the center point and the figures were arranged according to the order of motion.</p>
