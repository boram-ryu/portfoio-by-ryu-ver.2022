  2020.03 - 2020.05 <strong>Fold House</strong> for academic project. Fold house is a form of elederliness cohousing. The name is came from both shape of the mass and 'for+old'.
  <p>As the aging intensifis, the number of senior citizen who lives alone increases. Therefore, the need for senior co-housing is emerging recently. Accordingly, I propose the fold house for the site which is located in Yeonhui-dong, Seodaemun-gu.</p>
  <p>This co-housing provides a place for economic activities through common pursuit for elderly residents. It also tries to revitalize the social community by providing various community space. Furthermore, indoor leisure space is located inside the house for elderly who spend a lot of time staying at home. I also focused on the arrangement of nature for the elderly who miss the green of their hometown.</p>
