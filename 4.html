  2021.09 - 2021.12 <strong>Seongnae primary school Renovation</strong> for academic project. Seongnae primary school is located in Seongnae-dong, Gangdong-gu.
  <p>The main problem of Seongnae primary school was the lack of students' space and special classrooms such as gym due to the limited space zoning. Therefore, I set a goal for resolving the problems and maintaining its placeness simultaneously.</p>
  <p>According to the development stage of students, I devided the space and made zoning. As the grade goes up, children can experience much bigger outdoor space and community space. The underground space is used for both students and residents and acts as sports facilities and special space.</p>
  <p>The arch that can be found at the elevation of preservation building is actively utilized as a design element. Also, some part of the outer wall of preservation building is used as inner wall, so it can be remembered continuously.</p>
