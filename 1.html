  2021.07 - 2021.08 <strong>Floating Island</strong> for LH corporation competiton. We tried to create <u>a community island</u> that would be a haeven for drifting young entrepreneurs and beginners in society.
  <p>The site is located in Ilsanseo-gu, Goyang-si, next to Ilsan station, Gyeongui Jungang line. Because of that, it is advantageous for <u>connection to forest walkway</u> and also to <u>Ilsan fifth-day market</u>, a historic traditional market. Furthermore, the site is planned to be regenerated for youth start-ups and culture. </p>
  <p>The lower floor is actively connecting to the forest walkway of Gyeongui line and it induces access from various visitors. Also, commerciality was enhanced thourgh the extension of Ilsan fifth-day market axis. Therefore, it was intended to increase the utilization of space for youth art creation, exhibition, and sale, which are the main programs of the low-rise area.</p>
